🚇 Dhaka Metro Rail Navigation System
A comprehensive C++ application that provides route planning, distance calculation, and fare estimation for the Dhaka Metro Rail Line-6. This object-oriented project demonstrates advanced programming concepts while solving real-world transportation challenges.

🌟 Features
Route Planning: Find shortest paths between stations based on distance or time

Fare Calculation: Automatic fare estimation based on number of stations

Interactive Map: Visual representation of the metro network

Data Persistence: Save and load station data to/from files

Real-time Navigation: Get detailed path instructions with interchange information

🛠️ Technical Highlights
Object-Oriented Design: Utilizes inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation

Advanced Algorithms: Implements Dijkstra's algorithm for optimal path finding

Template Classes: Generic Pair class for reusable data structures

File Handling: Persistent data storage and retrieval

STL Containers: Efficient use of maps, vectors, queues, and stacks

Operator Overloading: Custom operators for intuitive class usage
